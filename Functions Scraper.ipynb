I don\\'t think it\\'s right that they list grass-fed whey on the box knowing that that\\'s what people want and that you have to put your glasses on to find out that it\\'s actually got non grass-fed whey protein isolate and milk protein isolate. The bar does taste good though, if the the source of your protein doesn\\'t matter to you.'"
